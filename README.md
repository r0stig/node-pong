Node Pong
=========

This is a really simple two player pong game written in Javascript, both on the client and on the server (Node.js).

To clone:
> git clone https://github.com/r0stig/node-pong.git 

To play: start the pong server by typing:
> node app.js

Then open your browser and go to localhost:3000 in two windows/tabs, the first player to join (open the page) gets the left paddle, the second player the right paddle. When a player disconnects the game gets paused and the next player joining the game take the place of the disconnected player.

Use the up and down arrow to move your padde.
